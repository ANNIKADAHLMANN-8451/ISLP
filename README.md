# ISLP

## What is ISLP?

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) ("ISLR" or "ISLP", with R and Python compatability, respectively) is a great practical introduction to machine learning. This repository is translated from the Python version of the ISL book. Please note that some sections skip around questions or don't directly parallel the book due to the inability to convert for various reasons. Additionally, the answers to the Applied Exercises offer **A** solution, not **THE** only solution. So you may find yourself with different solutions that also results in a correct answer to the given question. 

The repository is built into different sections within the Python Lab and Applied Exercises. I am not providing solutions to any Conceptual Exercises. I will include any relevant concept or rationale as comments within the code.  

## How is this repository arranged?

This repository is divided into chapters. Each chapter is divided into two subfolders - 
1. **Python Lab:** This contains Python Codes from the Python Labs section. These are marked according to the relevant sections. Therefore, a file named 3.6.3.ipynb means it contains code in Jupyter Notebook from Section 3.6.3 of the R Lab (within Chapter 3).
2. **Applied Exercises:** This contains Python Codes from Applied Exercises from each chapter. The Applied Exercises will contain some sub-questions which ask the reader to interpret the model rather than code it. I will provide solutions to those questions for the sake of completeness, when applicable.
